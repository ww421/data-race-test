#summary ThreadSanitizer build bot

= Buildbot location=
We have a [http://build.chromium.org/p/client.tsan/waterfall continuous build of ThreadSanitizer] where the fresh binaries are built regularly.<br/>
Please make sure the bots are green for the given revision when downloading a TSan binary. 

=Downloading TSan binaries=
You may download the latest ThreadSanitizer binaries at
[http://build.chromium.org/p/client.tsan/binaries].<br>

===for Linux and Mac===
For example, to get the r4356 build for x86_64 Linux you will need to do:
{{{
wget http://build.chromium.org/p/client.tsan/binaries/tsan-r4356-amd64-linux-self-contained.sh
chmod +x tsan-r4356-amd64-linux-self-contained.sh
}}}

===for Windows==
For Windows, we store the binaries as self-extracting [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7z] archives<br>
For example, to get the r4356 package, please download and run<br> [http://build.chromium.org/p/client.tsan/binaries/tsan-r4356-x86-windows-sfx.exe]<br>
This will extract the binaries into a `tsan-x86-windows` subdirectory, `tsan.bat` is what you want.
